# 🧠 CodFix – AI-Powered Code Intelligence Platform

CodFix is a full-stack AI-powered web application designed to assist developers with **intelligent code completion**, **bug detection and debugging**, and **automatic testcase generation**. By leveraging pre-trained machine learning models and an interactive web interface, CodFix streamlines common software development tasks and improves coding efficiency and reliability.

The system integrates a **React-based frontend** for seamless user interaction with a **Python backend** that serves pre-trained AI models for real-time inference, making advanced code intelligence accessible through a single unified platform.

## 📌 Project Overview

Modern software development involves repetitive tasks such as writing boilerplate code, debugging errors, and manually creating testcases. These tasks are time-consuming and error-prone.

CodFix addresses the following challenges:
- Manual effort in writing and completing code
- Time-consuming bug identification and debugging
- Lack of automated testcase generation
- Fragmented tooling for development assistance

By combining AI-driven models with a user-friendly interface, CodFix provides an end-to-end solution for improving developer productivity.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

### Software
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm
- Git

### Hardware
- Minimum: 8 GB RAM
- Recommended: 16 GB RAM or higher

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nreddyg07/CodFix.git
cd CodFix
````

---

### Backend Setup (Python)

Create and activate a virtual environment:

**Windows**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Frontend Setup (React)

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

CodFix uses **concurrently** to run both the frontend and backend together.

### Start the Application

```bash
npm start
```

This single command will:

* Start the React frontend
* Start the Python backend (`App.py`)
* Enable real-time communication between frontend and backend

---

### 🌐 Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🧠 Model Training

> **Important:**
> All model training for CodFix was performed in **Google Colab** and is **not intended to be executed locally**.

The following scripts were used **only in Google Colab** for dataset preparation and training:

* `scrapping.py` — Dataset scraping and preprocessing
* `code_completion_training.py` — Code completion model training
* `debugging_training.py` — Bug detection and debugging model training
* `testcase_generation.py` — Automatic testcase generation

These scripts require GPU acceleration and large compute resources.

---

### 🚫 Do Not Run Training Scripts Locally

```bash
python scrapping.py
python code_completion_training.py
python debugging_training.py
python testcase_generation.py
```

The local application uses **pre-trained models only**.

---

## 🧪 Final Execution Flow

```bash
# One-time setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install

# Run frontend + backend together
npm start
```

---

## 🌍 Applications

* Software development assistance
* Academic and student projects
